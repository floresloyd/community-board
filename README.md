## Notes

1. Learning the Basics of React: Getting acquainted with React can be a steep learning curve, especially for beginners, but it's a fundamental skill for building web applications with React.

2. Revisiting Vanilla CSS: Transitioning from more advanced CSS frameworks or preprocessors to vanilla CSS can be challenging, as it may require more manual styling and management of styles.

3. Git and Version Control: Git and version control can be complex, and mastering branching, merging, and resolving conflicts can be a challenge, particularly when working on a collaborative project.

4. Mobile Responsiveness: Ensuring that a website is mobile-responsive can be tricky, as it involves adjusting layouts and styles to work effectively on various screen sizes and devices. It's a common challenge in web development projects.
